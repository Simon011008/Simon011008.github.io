Deep Learning Running Speed
====
GPU VS CPU
------
Hardware is an important factor affecting the running speed of deep learning!
When running deep learning tasks, GPUs are typically much faster than CPUs. The main reason is the architectural difference between the two.

The GPU contains hundreds to thousands of small cores, which makes it very efficient at handling parallel tasks. Many operations in deep learning are well suited to parallelization. Therefore, GPUs are very suitable for running deep learning.
